# Sam Ashcroft Bio
Sam is doing a PhD human behaviour, and for this he analyses the data from Python-based computer experiments and psychophysiological recordings using R, Excel and SPSS.

He also teaches Research Methods and Statistics at degree-level as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. Sam teaches various statistical techniques using data-analysis software. Additionally, he teaches how to write up and present research and statistics to a publishable standard.

Sam is the founder and President of the Data Science Society - a supportive community of PhDs/MScs/UGs and Staff that practice or are interested in Data Science using Python, R, and SQL.

He has been on more research projects than he can count - through paid Research Assistant jobs, internships, his PhD, voluntary work and work experience.

CodeUp is a national coding organisation, and Sam is co-organiser of the Cheshire branch.

Cleaning (really) messy datasets and analysing them to get clear, actionable results is what Sam enjoys most.
